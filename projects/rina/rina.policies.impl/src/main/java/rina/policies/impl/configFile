# AllocateNotifyPolicy
# This policy determines when the requesting application is given an Allocate_Response primitive.  
# In general, the choices are once the request is determined to be well-formed and a create_flow 
# request has been sent, or withheld until a create_flow response has been received and retries 
# have been exhausted.


# AllocateRetryPolicy
# This policy is used when the destination has refused the create_flow request, and the FAI can 
# overcome the cause for refusal and try again.  This policy should re-formulate the request.  
# This policy should formulate the contents of the reply.
# For the demo: If the error is local and can be re-configured, then reformulate and re-try 
# else return negative to layer above


# FlowSetSelectionPolicy
# This policy is used when the SeqRollOverThres event occurs and action may be required by the Flow 
# Allocator to modify the bindings between connection-endpoint-ids and port-ids.
# For the demo: Not used


# NewFlowRequestPolicy
# This policy is used to convert an Allocate Request is into a create_flow request. Its primary
# task is to translate the request into the proper QoS-class-set, flow set, and access control capabilities.
# For the demo: Everything maps to a reliable QoS-cube
