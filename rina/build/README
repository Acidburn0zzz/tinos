=======

spring-build:
 Orginally copied from a SpringSource provided demo project. Since then it has been modified
 slightly to be used as the "template" spring-build area for a projects folder with OSGi 
 components sitting inside it. To get the latest version of this folder should be sync
 to (but doesnt) go here:
	
	git://git.springsource.org/spring-build/spring-build.git

scripts:
 Also copied from one of the SpringSource OSGi demo projects. Originally it allowed the
 creation of src project areas for OSGi bundles/par files in a manner that was compatiable
 with the SpringSource build system (spring-build -- above).

tinos:
 Extension scripts for the project creation scripts in the "scripts" folder. These have
 extended the baseline set that was originally there to the current project settings used
 in the tinos development.

Note:
 As always these are probably slightly behind the state of the art in project folders
for the build systems. So usually as new build/server features are available it will need
to be tweaked forward.
